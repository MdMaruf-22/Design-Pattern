The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to redefine specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. This promotes code reuse and ensures that the overall algorithm's sequence remains consistent while allowing flexibility in individual steps.

When to Identify and Use the Template Method Pattern

Look for scenarios where:
You have a similar sequence of operations (like processes, workflows, or algorithms) that can be defined at a high level but need specific steps implemented by subclasses.
You want to avoid duplicating code in multiple classes that share a common algorithm or process.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Similar algorithms" or "shared steps" mentioned across different classes.
"Common sequence of operations" but with variations in certain steps.
Need for maintaining a consistent process while allowing for flexibility in specific actions.
