The Null Object Pattern provides a default, "do nothing" object in situations where a null value would otherwise be used. This avoids null checks and reduces the risk of NullPointerException errors. The idea is to create a class that behaves like the real object but does nothing.

How to Identify the Use of Null Object Pattern:
Look for scenarios where the absence of an object (like a logger, database connection, or handler) would normally require null checks.
If the object is optional, but the code still works with or without it, and you want to avoid null checks, the Null Object pattern is likely a good fit.
