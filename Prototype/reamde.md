The Prototype pattern is used when you need to create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype). Instead of creating new instances from scratch, you can create a copy (clone) of an existing object, which can be much faster and more efficient. This is especially useful when object creation is complex or time-consuming.

When to Identify and Use the Prototype Pattern
Consider using the Prototype pattern if:
The problem involves creating similar objects multiple times.
Creating objects from scratch is expensive (time-consuming or resource-heavy).
You need a flexible way to clone existing objects and make slight modifications to them.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Cloning," "copying," or "replicating" objects.
"Creating many similar objects."
A requirement to quickly duplicate objects that are hard to create from scratch.
