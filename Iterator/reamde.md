The Iterator pattern is used to traverse elements of a collection (like a list, set, or array) without exposing its underlying implementation. It provides a standard way to access elements sequentially, regardless of the collection type.The Iterator pattern lets you iterate over a collection of objects one at a time in a standardized way, using an interface with methods like:

hasNext(): Checks if there are more elements.
next(): Retrieves the next element.
remove(): Optionally removes elements.
This is especially useful when you want to separate how you access elements from how the collection itself is structured.

How to Identify When to Use the Iterator Pattern
------------------------------------------------
In a scenario, look for situations like:
Sequential Access: When you need to traverse or "surf" through items in a collection (like channels or programs).
Encapsulation of Collection: If the problem mentions that the internal structure of a collection should be hidden, or you need to access elements without knowing how the collection is implemented.
Avoiding Direct Access: If the scenario mentions that you shouldn't access the collection directly and need a standardized way to traverse elements.
