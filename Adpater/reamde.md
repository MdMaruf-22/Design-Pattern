The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two different interfaces, enabling classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate without changing their existing code.This pattern is useful when you want to use an existing class, but its interface does not match the one you need.

When to Identify and Use the Adapter Pattern
Look for scenarios where:
You need to make two incompatible interfaces work together.
You have existing code or libraries with different interfaces, and you want to integrate them without modifying their original code.
You want to create a bridge between two systems with incompatible interfaces so they can work seamlessly together.

Key clues in the scenario:
Different or incompatible interfaces between classes that need to collaborate.
The need for a "wrapper" or "translator" to bridge the gap between two incompatible systems.
You want to reuse an existing class whose interface doesn’t match what’s needed by the client.
