The Composite pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is useful when you have a hierarchical structure of objects, where individual objects (leaf nodes) and compositions of objects (composite nodes) are treated in the same way.This pattern is often used for handling tree-like structures such as file systems, graphical components, or organizational hierarchies.

When to Use the Composite Pattern
Look for scenarios with:
Hierarchical structures of objects (like products and boxes, files and folders, etc.).
The need to treat individual objects (like a Product) and groups of objects (like a Box) in the same way.
A situation where you need to aggregate objects and perform operations on the group, but some of the groupâ€™s items could be composites themselves.
