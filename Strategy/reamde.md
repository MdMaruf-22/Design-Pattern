The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms (or behaviors), encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable. The object using the algorithm can choose the behavior at runtime without changing its own structure.This is useful when you need to change how something is done (e.g., sorting, payment methods, or game strategies) dynamically, without altering the object that uses these behaviors.

When to Identify and Use the Strategy Pattern

Look for scenarios where:
You need to perform an action (like payment, sorting, or calculating) in different ways that can change at runtime.
You want to avoid having a lot of if-else or switch statements to handle different variations of the same behavior.
The behavior or algorithm should be easily interchangeable.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Different ways of performing the same task" (e.g., paying with credit card, PayPal, Bitcoin).
"Interchangeable behaviors" or "dynamic switching" of algorithms at runtime.
"The object should delegate the task to a strategy."
