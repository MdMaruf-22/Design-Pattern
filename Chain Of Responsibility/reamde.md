The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of the handlers processes the request. Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it on to the next handler in the chain.This pattern is particularly useful when you don’t know beforehand which handler will process a request or when you want to give multiple handlers a chance to process it.

When to Identify and Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Look for scenarios where:
A request needs to be passed along a chain of potential handlers until one of them processes it.
You want to avoid a large if-else structure where you check multiple conditions to handle a request.
You don’t want to hard-code which handler will process the request; instead, you want to let each handler decide if it can handle the request.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Different handlers" that may be responsible for processing a request.
The request needs to be processed by only one handler in the chain.
The ability to add new handlers without modifying existing ones.
