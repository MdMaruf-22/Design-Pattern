The Decorator pattern allows you to add new behavior to objects dynamically without modifying their structure. Instead of using inheritance to extend functionality, the Decorator pattern lets you wrap an object with additional functionality. This is useful when you want to extend the behavior of objects in a flexible and reusable way.

When to Identify and Use the Decorator Pattern

Look for scenarios where:
You need to add or enhance behaviors of objects dynamically (at runtime).
There is a need to extend an objectâ€™s functionality without changing its code or using complex inheritance hierarchies.
Multiple features or enhancements need to be stacked on top of each other.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Adding new behavior" or "extending functionality" at runtime.
Avoiding "too many subclasses" or "combining features in different ways."
When the behavior can be layered or combined (e.g., adding email, SMS, and push notifications).
