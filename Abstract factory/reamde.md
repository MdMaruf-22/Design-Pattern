The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Itâ€™s useful when you need to create objects that are related or dependent on each other but want to ensure that you use the correct combinations of objects (e.g., modern chairs with modern tables).

In simpler terms, instead of creating individual objects like we did with the Factory Method, the Abstract Factory deals with groups of related objects that belong to the same "family" (e.g., different types of animals from different ecosystems, different furniture styles, etc.).

When to Identify and Use the Abstract Factory
Look for scenarios where:

The problem involves creating families of related objects (like matching chairs and sofas, or modern and Victorian styles).
You need to make sure that the objects you create are consistent (e.g., modern chair goes with modern sofa).
The system must be scalable and allow the addition of new object families (e.g., Art Deco furniture) without modifying existing code.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Related objects" or "matching sets of objects."
"Creating different versions or styles" (e.g., modern, Victorian, etc.).
"Ensuring that the correct combination of objects is used together."
