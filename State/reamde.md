The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. Instead of using many conditional statements (like if-else or switch), you encapsulate different behaviors in separate state objects, and the object changes its state at runtime to alter its behavior.

When to Identify and Use the State Pattern

Look for scenarios where:
The behavior of an object depends on its state.
The object needs to change its behavior dynamically when its internal state changes.
Avoiding complex if-else or switch statements that handle state transitions is necessary.

Key clues in the scenario:
"Different states" or "modes" (e.g., playing, paused, stopped).
"Behavior changes based on the state."
"Need to switch between different states at runtime."
