The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as in cases of logging, configuration management, or database connections. The pattern achieves this by:
Making the constructor private to prevent external instantiation.
Providing a static method to return the single instance.
Ensuring that this instance is created only once (often using lazy initialization).
